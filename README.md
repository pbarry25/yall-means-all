# Overview

TL;DR: This is designed to be a lightweight capture of companies/organizations (and their job postings) who continue to make investments and commitments to their DEI programs.

Disclaimer: [I](https://github.com/pbarry25) am not directly affiliated with any of the companies listed here.

This is simplly a curated list of companies who have active, funded DEI programs.

The target audience here includes (but is not limited to):

* folks who want to work for a company that values diversity, equity, and inclusion
* folks who want to support companies that value diversity, equity, and inclusion
* folks looking for work, in general

Each row below contains links to the following:

* the company's main website
* the company's 'careers' landing page, if they have one (usually these are geared toward 'talking up' the benefits of joining the company)
* the current listing of open positions/jobs with the company
* the company's page about their DEI programs (or other similar resource)

And PR's/feedback encouraged! :)
